## Overview

First and foremost, I am grateful of Udacity for offering a 30-day free trial for Nanodegree Programs during the COVID-19 season -- motivating individuals including myself who'd otherwise be very "outdoorsy" to `#stayhome`.

While much of the repository were based on instructions and guides from the Udacity Nanodegree Curriculum, here I pledge that I have independently completed the Nanodegree projects, provided citations to resources given by the instructional team, and strictly abided the [Udacity Honor Code](https://www.udacity.com/legal/en-us/community-guidelines). Citations are provided for code given by Udacity or obtained elsewhere that have not been incorporated into the iOS developer ecosystem.


## List of Nanodegree Projects

This repository hosts 4 project assignments created by Udacity [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003) and were implemented by me in partial fulfillment of the Nanodegree certificate. The repo is publicly available for evaluation purposes.

1. _Pitch Perfect_
2. _MemeMe_

In addition:

  - `sample_apps/` subdirectory consists of code for sample apps (usually single-view apps). Some projects were initialized by Udacity for learning purposes
  - The final project is not included in this repository, but a separate one


Finally, please note that code, materials, and ideas in this repository maybe subject to copyright and the Udacity Honor Code (if applicable), so please behave _responsibly_.
