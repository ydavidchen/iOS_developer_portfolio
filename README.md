# Udacity _iOS Developer_ Nanodegree Project Portfolio

Notes:
  - Xcode v11E146
  - Simiulator iPhone 11 Pro Max

## Overview

First and foremost, I am grateful of Udacity for offering a 30-day free trial for Nanodegree Programs during the COVID-19 season -- motivating individuals including myself who'd otherwise be very "outdoorsy" to `#stayhome`.

While much of the repository were based on instructions and guides from the Udacity Nanodegree Curriculum, here I pledge that I have independently completed the Nanodegree projects, provided citations to resources given by the instructional team, and strictly abided the [Udacity Honor Code](https://www.udacity.com/legal/en-us/community-guidelines). Citations are provided for code given by Udacity or obtained elsewhere that have not been incorporated into the iOS developer ecosystem.

## List of Projects

### Projects Required by Nanodegree

This repository hosts 4 project assignments created by Udacity [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003) and were implemented by me in partial fulfillment of the Nanodegree certificate. The repo is publicly available for evaluation purposes. Each project is located within the immediate sub-directory of the main repository folder.

1. _Pitch Perfect_
2. _MemeMe_ (2 milestones)

The final project is not included in this repository, but as a stand-alone repo (LINK TBD).

### Sample Apps

Sample apps are exercises, tutorials, or components leading up to a one of the projects above. They are not required components of the Nanodegree certificate. Please note that the template / starter code of many sample apps are provided by Udacity as a teaching tool or self-guided programming drills. All sample apps are located in the sub-directory `sample_apps/`, in their respective sub-sub-directories.

* _Pitch Perfect_ module
* _MemeMe 1.0_ submodule
  - _ColorMaker_ (switches, sliders)
  - TextFields (textviews, delegates)
* _MemeMe 2.0_ submodule
