# Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Projects

Student: David Chen (GitHub @ydavidchen)

  - Xcode v11E146
  - Simiulator iPhone 11 Pro Max


## Overview

First and foremost, I am grateful of Udacity for offering a 30-day free trial for Nanodegree Programs during the COVID-19 season -- motivating individuals including myself to `#stayhome` who'd otherwise be very "outdoorsy".

While much of the repository were based on instructions and guides from the Udacity Nanodegree Curriculum, here I pledge that I have independently wrote Swift code without copy and pasting from external sources and strictly abided the [Udacity Honor Code](https://www.udacity.com/legal/en-us/community-guidelines).
