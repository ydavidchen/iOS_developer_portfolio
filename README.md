# Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Projects

## Overview

First and foremost, I am grateful of Udacity for offering a 30-day free trial for Nanodegree Programs during the COVID-19 season -- motivating individuals including myself to `#stayhome` who'd otherwise be very "outdoorsy".

Here, I pledge that I have independently wrote Swift code without copy and pasting from external sources, and followed the [Udacity Honor Code](https://www.udacity.com/legal/en-us/community-guidelines).
