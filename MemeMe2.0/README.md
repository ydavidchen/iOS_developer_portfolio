# MemeMe 2.0

David Chen

## Overview

This is the code repository for the second iteration of the _MemeMe_ app, as part of the Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree program projects.

## New Features

* Upon sharing, save a `meme` to
  - Menu (_ViewController_) via shared model in _AppDelegate_
  - iOS Photo Album
* _Tab Bar_ controller with either:
  - _TableView_
  - _CollectionView_

In addition, I optimized from the previous iteration of the app, including

* Abstracted procedures used more than once as reusable methods in the _Meme_ custom class
* Better _.swift_ sectioning / re-organization
