# _On The Map_: an iOS Project

Udacity iOS Nanodegree Project on Networking and API

## Overview

This app features:

* Login and Authentication Activity (_Udacity_ API)
  - Login via Facebook account has NOT been enabled
* Navigation View with Map and Table Lists (_Parse API_)
* Post check-in pin and link

Note: I followed _specifications_ outlined in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPF1tmSzVYPSbpl7_JCeMKglKMIs3dUa4OrSAKEYNAs/pub?embedded=true), which appears to have some discrepancies compared to the Udacity Video DEMO lecture.

## Credit

The app idea and associated image assets were given by Udacity iOS Nanodegree Program. All code were written by myself.
